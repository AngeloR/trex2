Well, apparently my love for technology is spurned yet again - the first backup laptop has died. I think I expected this day for a while. I have my entire personal life floating around in various sections of the internet just in case something like this happens. While that actually scares me, at this point I have no alternatives. My actual desktop is sitting in a basement in Toronto and for the last little while I have been travelling quite a bit. Perhaps when I get back I'll investigate purchasing a little 1U to use as my own personal OwnCloud." created="Thu, 17 Oct 2013 06:39:51 GMT"/>
						<outline text="However, my backup laptop was only ever meant to be temporary, so the hardware on it was dubious at best. Recently it decided that it was in its best interests to delete various portions of the MBR equivalent in Windows 8.1. I'm not going to argue with it - I'm sure it was privy to some information that I was not. Perhaps the BIOS was plotting with the CPU to attack my thighs and Windows stepped in to save them. Or maybe my RAM attempted to escape one night by masquerading as a hard drive. I'll never be entirely sure. At the end though, I was up a creek without my laptop.

						<outline text="So I did what any self respecting developer would do. I thought about how best to go about getting my development environment back in a way that allowed me to get back to work ASAP. Preferably on ANY computer. Now I've always loved the idea of &quot;Proving your Start-up for free&quot; - the idea that with all the freemium SAAS offerings out there you can take your idea all the way to prototype for zero money. I wondered if I could do the same to my development environment. Obviously it wouldn't be free - but as low cost as possible." created="Sun, 20 Oct 2013 20:58:57 GMT"/>

Root site is &lt;a href=&quot;http://digitalocean.com&quot;&gt;http://digitalocean.com&lt;/a&gt;). The best way that I know of vetting a service for use isn't to go through the site but just Google &quot;[service_name] sucks&quot;. Then go through a few of them. As with Digital Ocean I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://serdardogruyol.com/?p=137&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. Horrifying experience with Digital Ocean right? Until you read the comments.. where the CEO replies in detail (After receiving permission to do so), with emails, and a detailed explanation of what happened. And after reading it, they seemed to handle the situation in the best way possible - so I set up a 5$ server with DO and after.. maybe 30 minutes? Had my environment up and running.

						<outline text="Now, from ANY machine I can SSH into my development environment and have things exactly as I want. Tmux and vim make for a very powerful development environment and allows me to work anywhere. Obviously, not everyone can take this approach - but for me it works quite perfectly.

To back it up he talked about a paper published by Carol S.

						<outline text="I'll agree - those two points are ridiculous. Of course being good at math isn't something you're born with. Of course there's no gender bias in math. But just because you're good at something, doesn't mean you're going to do it for the rest of your life. For example, I'm good at playing the guitar. I wasn't born with an innate ability - I've just spent the last 10 years practicing for hours almost every single day until I was better. But just because I'm good at it doesn't mean I can go release an Album and start touring. " created="Fri, 11 Oct 2013 17:39:44 GMT"/>

That drive is a part of Tef - it has nothing to do with a programming language. But he had a drive that lead to him becoming a programmer. Was that learned, or was it something he just needed to do?

						<outline text="I love Vim. I love it because it makes creating new code a breeze. I can instantly hop anywhere in a file, move/adjust content, and I have keyboard shortcuts that control EVERYTHING about my environment. With Vim, coding stops being about me typing new words and starts being this weird, beautiful dance of alphanumerics, colons, and the capslock key. (I mapped the capslock key to ESC, because I can't think of a GOOD reason for capslock). I'm moving between multiple panes, copying and pasting content around, writing entire applications. Infact, ALL of the code that I wrote for Airpost Systems was done in Vim.  " created="Thu, 18 Jul 2013 05:55:41 GMT"/>
						<outline text="So why did I start using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/&quot;&gt;IntelliJIDEA&lt;/a&gt;? I ran into a large library that I'd never seen before. I needed to read and understand every little bit of it because there were some memory issues that were halting the product. I wanted to run the code and debug my node instance. I wanted to step through the code, and watch the output. I couldn't do that with Vim. I'm sure it's possible, but I couldn't afford to waste time googling how to do it. I needed this piece done ASAP. So I searched through my email for my IntelliJIDEA license and downloaded the version off their website and was up and running pretty quickly. " created="Thu, 18 Jul 2013 06:04:55 GMT"/>
						<outline text="See I think Vim is great for when I'm trying to make new code. When I know what I want and I can get lost in that code-blur of pane-hopping, new files and keyboard shortcuts. However, when I'm sitting there trying to grasp a new, large library. Having an IDE that I can visually step through is phenomenal. " created="Thu, 18 Jul 2013 06:09:51 GMT"/>

I love that I can grab it on EVERY server I ssh in to, and I have a .vimrc setup, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen&quot;&gt;pathogen&lt;/a&gt;, that gives me an environment that I can get a ton of work done in. I'm proficient enough in Vim that I can hop in and actually get REAL work done, without needing to fight the editor. However, when things explode and I'm simply trying to track down an error, I think I might hop in to IntelliJIDEA." created="Thu, 18 Jul 2013 06:07:16 GMT"/>

						<outline text="And no one cares, because there's a huge disconnect between the person who buys the software, the person who builds the software and the person who uses the software.

						<outline text="Not to mention the disconnect between the builders and the business process. See 9 out of 10 times, the person &quot;building&quot; the software only has a vague set of requirements that they've hashed out from meetings with the buyers.

" created="Thu, 11 Jul 2013 07:09:03 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Of course, no one thinks about asking the users what they want. No one wants to talk to Anne who's been working at the company for 7+ years and was there for the &quot;software refresh&quot; that went terribly. No one thinks to talk to Dave who's been sitting there for the last 3 years using the software that's going to be replaced.

Every programming language supports reading XML, which is what RSS is written in. That means that ANYTHING can consume RSS feeds. You know the little twitter widget that a lot of sites have? The one that shows you your recent tweets? RSS can do that without any JavaScript Cross-Origin Resource Sharing issues. RSS isn't just for blogs - it's a way to disseminate content to the masses.

Infact, I'm now such a hard-core Steam fan that if a game isn't on Steam there's a high likelihood that I'll never get around to owning it. See for me, owning CD's, remembering where they (and their keys) were, having to keep them carefully and finding new games was all a huge hassle. Steam solved that for me. They are my favourite. Infact, I gladly buy games on steam that I wouldn't have even looked at in a store because they were on sale. " created="Thu, 20 Jun 2013 23:19:55 GMT"/>

							<outline text="Then there's &quot;data at rest&quot; which deals with your data AFTER it gets wherever it's going.

I've just kinda turned a blind eye and claimed &quot;I've made my decision - my life is an open book&quot;. But it's not. There are things I want to keep to myself, and as Moxie Marlinspike points out - there are things I probably&lt;a href=&quot;http://thoughtcrime.org/blog/we-should-all-have-something-to-hide/&quot;&gt; want to hide&lt;/a&gt;.

That means no more clicking &quot;OK&quot; to the terms of service essentially selling my data. I want it all.

They get lost in the technical details and fail to see how queues really should be planned and organized to get the most out of them." created="Wed, 12 Jun 2013 20:41:28 GMT"/>
							<outline text="Imagine you're at a grocery store with a single checkout counter and a single queue, where all the shoppers are lining up. You go up to the queue, and join the back - after all, all these people have been waiting before you, don't be rude. The check out counter then calls the first person in line forward.

								</outline>
							<outline text="This process will continue to repeat for as long as there are people in the queue. As soon as everyone in the queue is gone, the person at the counter will just sit there and wait until someone shows up. That's their job as a worker. " created="Wed, 12 Jun 2013 20:48:21 GMT"/>
							<outline text="Notice that the queue didn't exist at the checkout counter itself, it existed BEFORE the checkout counter. This is the biggest benefit of having a queue system. Now, if we open a second counter next to the first, they can utilize the same queue and ideally get twice as much work done. Add a third, and three times the work gets done. " created="Wed, 12 Jun 2013 20:49:15 GMT"/>
							<outline text="However! That only works when the counters never need to talk to each other. The minute a counter needs to talk to another counter to verify something BOTH counters need to stop working to talk before they can go back to whatever they were doing. This is where a lot of problems happen, and causes slowdowns and forces the queues to backup.

							<outline text="One of the favourite features of Queues seems to be overlooked a lot of the time. Queues provide a place for data to wait until you get to processing it. This means that if your processing side ever breaks, or needs to be taken offline temporarily YOU'RE NOT LOSING USER DATA. Data is still being collected in the queue and when your workers come back online they can get right back to work retroactively processing the data that was waiting for them." created="Wed, 12 Jun 2013 20:42:54 GMT"/>

Do I have to rely on the next tool builder (me or someone else) to create a Wordpress importer so that I don't lose all my content? " created="Fri, 17 May 2013 01:37:51 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I am also very forgetful. Not a &quot;Did I leave the stove on?&quot; forgetful, but the  &quot;Have I eaten today?&quot; kind. As such, I need to write down everything I do. If I don't, I'm pretty much guaranteed to forget it. I have a bunch of ways that I keep track of things. I use Evernote to capture all of my meetings and ideas and to have references to things. I've tried using it to organize what I need to do, or even to organize my thoughts, but my mind doesn't work that way. I find that old-school Outliners really work the way I think. Multiple thoughts and details can quickly be added without needing to worry about things. " created="Fri, 17 May 2013 01:39:19 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I've tried a bunch of different outliners before settling on Workflowy a few months ago. It provides a super simply, web-based outliner that lets me do what I need. They offer me the ability to export my data and link to specific nodes and share things - which is awesome. However, something still irked me about it and always stayed my hand from actually paying for it." created="Fri, 17 May 2013 01:42:23 GMT"/>

						<outline text="&lt;a href=&quot;http://fargo.io&quot;&gt;Fargo.io&lt;/a&gt; is a new tool released by Dave Winer - the same man who inspired my &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsriver.ca&quot;&gt;NewsRiver&lt;/a&gt; project. It's a web interface that writes to YOUR Dropbox account. Basically I can hop in to Fargo from ANY internet connected device (thanks to Bootstrap as well for that functionality) and I can write and organize my thoughts in an Outliner that saves itself to my Dropbox account.  " created="Fri, 17 May 2013 01:44:01 GMT"/>
						<outline text="I've been using it for a bit transitioning all my stuff out of Workflowy into Fargo and I'm already liking it a lot more. A lot of customization options (Custom CSS? Yes please!) as well as the ability to post right from my outliner to Wordpress. That's right - this post is written in Fargo.io and with a couple clicks it's imported right in to my Wordpress powered site. " created="Fri, 17 May 2013 01:45:33 GMT"/>
						<outline text="Of course - now that the thing that powers my website is no longer locked to Wordpress, maybe it's time to investigate writing my own blogging system that integrates a bit better with Fargo." created="Fri, 17 May 2013 01:48:23 GMT"/>
