# Trex2
This is an unofficial re-write of the Trex blogging engine that can be used 
to power websites managed through [Fargo](http://fargo.io). 

This is a very early stage release of the engine - I haven't had that much time 
to work on it yet but my goal is to finish and release it before the end of 
November. 

# Involvement
If you're interested in working on a bug, fork, patch, submit a pull request. 
Right now I don't have any strong guidelines on pull requests, just make sure 
that it doesn't introduce any odd bugs. I'd appreciate some kind of unit 
testing, but since I haven't exactly added any to the system right now, I feel 
guilty asking you to.

# Todo 
- Google Analytics Support
- Disqus Support
- Rules support
- Non-homepage templates
